These soft skills that are going to be discussed below are for backend developers, but they can be applied generally for any role as in Back-End related jobs.
### Problem Solving
Backend development involves dealing with complex problems. Analytical thinking enables developers to reduce complex issues and evaluate possible solutions. Troubleshooting capabilities ensure that backend developers can isolate and fix system problems with much less downtime and a better-quality user experience.
### Communication Skills
Effective communication is one of the strongest backend developer skills. The better a backend developer can collaborate with their frontend developer, the better the whole user experience will be. Backend developers must be able to explain complicated ideas simply.
### Time Management and Organization
Backend developers work on so many responsibilities, ranging from debugging code to designing new features. They should know how to balance tasks that require prioritization and effective workflows. On-time delivery is crucial in development cycles for keeping the project going.
### Agility and Continuous Learning
(agility: ability to move quickly and easily.)
Backend developers need to learn quickly and adapt to new tools and technologies. From new programming languages to new frameworks and platforms, backend developers should be better positioned to benefit from modern solutions. They should be lifelong learners who 
look out for opportunities to expand their sets of skills required for backend developers.

##### Red flags:
###### Poor Problem-Solving Skills
A developer who is weak at problem-solving can make progress on a project difficult and may confuse the debugging process. Be in a way that you won't stumble over coding tests and be unable to give systematic solutions to hypothetical problems.
###### Weak Communication Skills
Backend developers should be able to work with front-end developers, explain technical ideas to stakeholders, and write legible documentation.   Try to not have inability and be able to clarify ideas or describe technical solutions.
###### Inability to Work in a Team
Application developers must collaborate with other colleagues, such as designers, project managers, and testers, for the development of integrated applications. Don't get yourself into  conflicts in roles and be willing to share experiences with teamwork.
