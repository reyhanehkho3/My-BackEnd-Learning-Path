### Class
A blueprint for an object.


### Object
an object is an instance of the class.



### Data Abstraction
 Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information about the data to the outside world, hiding the background details or implementation.


### Encapsulation
Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates. In Encapsulation, the variables or data of a class are hidden from any other class and can be accessed only through any member function of their class in which they are declared. As in encapsulation, the data in a class is hidden from other classes, so it is also known as **data-hiding**.


### Inheritene
The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance.
 Inheritance allows the user to reuse the code whenever possible and reduce its redundancy.

### Polymorphism
- having many forms. 
- we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form.
